##  2Â½ - Grammar of Graphics
\

Data visualisations are based on an inherent underlying **Grammar of Graphics**.
This framework was developed by 
[Leland Wilkinson](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447)
in the 1990's and then repurposed more recently by 
[Hadley Wickham](https://byrneslab.net/classes/biol607/readings/wickham_layered-grammar.pdf),
who is a chief scientist at RStudio.

We will be using the `R` package `ggplot2` for our graphics. (`gg` stands for 
"grammar of graphics", and this is the second version of the package... hence 
the `2`).

### GRAMMAR OF GRAPHICS

Any data visualisation is a set of different _layers_ of information, as illustrated
in the image above. We'll go through the most important ones from bottom to top.  

**Data** is the most fundamental base layer. All figures are plotted from data.  

**Aesthetics** describe the mapping of data onto the graph. Foremost, aesthetics are used 
to state what the x-variable and y-variable are, although they can extend to other 
variables for more complex graphs (e.g. a third variable to colour data points, 
or a third axis for a 3D graph).  

**Geometries** describe how aesthetics are represented. This principally includes
the graph "type" (e.g. histogram, boxplot, barplot, scatter plot etc.).

**Facets** can be used to split a figure into sub-plots. Sometimes putting all 
data in one space is difficult to read, so a plot can be split out into different
facets according to chosen aesthetics.  

**Statistics** describe any models used to describe or predict the data. This 
may commonly include means and standard deviations, linear models or loess 
curves.  

**Coordinates** are not commonly used for simple graphs, but are useful when 
projecting the data into a different coordinate space. Mapping is the 
most obvious example: the same data can be plotted using many different 
geographic coordinate systems.



### `ggplot`
\

Functions and arguments in `ggplot2` mirror these layers. You'll encounter 
these methods in the next several chapters. The reason we're using `ggplot`
is because the graphics is produces are generally far better quality than 
the `base` `R` graphics. 

* `base R` graphics **GOOD** for: 
  + Quick, simple plots
  + Fast viewing of your data
  + Extremely flexible customisation _if you take considerable time to learn methods and code._
* `base R` graphics are **NOT good** for:
  + Not good for using for publications if you rely on default options, which are ugly.
  + Not good for customising plots _unless time is taken to learn how_
  + Not good for coherent coding (no underlying framework, order of functions very important)
  + Not good for tutorials available

* `ggplot` graphics are **GOOD** for:
  + Quickly producing and customising aesthetically pleasing plots 
  + Publication-quality figures out the box
  + Coherent code (clear underlying framework, order of functions flexible)
  + Easy access tutorials
* `ggplot` graphics are **NOT good** for:
  + Not good given lack of flexibility outside available options 
  + Not good for quick plots as more code is needed
  + Not good for viewing data fast
\

Here's an example of a scatter plot made using `ggplot` with the  with the toy 
data. 
\

```{r}
ggplot(toydata, aes(x = numbers2, y = random)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue4") +
  xlim(0, 20) + ylim(-2, 2) +
  xlab("Even numbers") + ylab("Random normal") +
  theme_minimal()
```
\

Take a look at the graph and the code, and it's possible to match up the different layers:

* The **DATA** is `toydata`.
* The **AESTHETICS** (in this case just x and y variables) are defined using `aes()`
* The **COORDINATES** are altered in a very simple way by changing the x and y 
axis limits using `xlim()` and `ylim()`
* The **THEME** is changed by applying the minimal theme using `theme_minimal()`.
