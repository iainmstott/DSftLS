### 1.1 THIS BOOK

First, some information on this web book.  
\ 

The book accompanies every student for 
the first 9 weeks of the module, after which the teaching and content start
to diverge for different programmes. This divergence allows programmes to learn 
analytical techniques which are relevant to their courses: some stay with 
content in this book, and some do not.  
\  

Here's a quick video tutorial on the layout of this book, and how it 
functions.

### CONTENT TYPES

Within the book you will find a diversity of content, which we'll go through 
in the next sections.  
\  


### 1.1.1 `R` Code

We are learning how to visualise, manage and analyse data in `R`. `R` is a 
**programming language**, and people who use it are variously called "programmers", 
"coders" or "developers".  
\

##### **Why R?**

You may have come across other programs that allow you to work with data, 
plot data and run statistical analyses. So why a programming language, and 
_why R?_  
\ 

##### **WHAT IS `R`?**
_Think of_ `R` _as a language_ you're writing in. 
"Running" R code from within a file allows you 
to communicate with the computer and instruct it to do something, 
resulting in outputs like plots or data.  
\ 

##### **WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF USING `R`?**

There are a _huge number of benefits to using R_, listed here and elaborated on in the video below.

1. It's **_free_**.
2. It's **_open source_**.
3. It's **_cross-platform_**.
4. It's **_transparent_** and **_replicable_**.
5. It's **_powerful_** and **_fast_**.
6. It's **_flexible_**.
7. It makes you **_employable_**.  
\ 

##### **WHAT IS RSTUDIO?**
We will be working with `R` in a program called **RStudio**; think of this like 
`R`'s Microsoft Word; i.e. a program that allows you to create, save and open `R` code
files; to edit those files and write `R` code. RStudio enables you to run `R` 
code, and get whatever output you need, whether it's a calculation, a subset 
of data, or a graph, for example.  
\ 

This video explains some of these concepts:

\  


##### **WHAT DOES `R` CODE LOOK LIKE?**

`R` often seems scary when you first 
encounter it, but as outlined in the _R Basics_ chapter, thinking of it like 
a language can help. As with learning a language, practise makes perfect. 
\ 

First of all, `R` code is always written in a `fixed width font`, where every 
character has the same width. This way it's easier to read, as the characters align 
vertically from line to line.  Short pieces of code may be written as `inline code`. 
Longer pieces of code (especially if they run over multiple lines) are written as a 
**code chunk**. Here's an example:  

```{r}
# draw random numbers
random <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)

# plot distribution
ggplot(as.data.frame(random), aes(x = random)) + 
    geom_density()

# mean
mean(random)

# standard deviation
sd(random)
```
\  

##### **WHAT DOES THE ABOVE CODE DO?**

1. Draws 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and 
standard deviation of 1.
2. Plots thie distribution of these numbers (this should look roughly like 
a normal-distribution-bell-curve).
3. Calculates the mean of the distribution (which should be close to zero)
4. Calculates the standard deviation of the distribution (which should be 
close to 1).  
\

##### **HOW CAN I "READ" THE CODE?**  

This is something that takes practice. Chapter 1 R Basics will help understand the vocabulary and grammar of `R` code, but for now...  

Take a look at the code alongside the description of what it does, and elements 
might start to match up. For example, 
`rnorm` could mean "random normal". `1000` is how many random normal numbers we want, 
`0` is the mean, and `1` is the standard deviation. Putting them together, 
`rnorm(1000, 0, 1)` calculates the data we want out of point 1: 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The 
next part uses `ggplot` and `geom_density`, so that has something 
to do with making a density plot (point 2). `mean` must calculate the mean
(point 3), and `sd` must calculate the standard deviation (point 4).  
\

You'll get to learn the specifics with time. `R` is _very_ literal and logical: you'll become used to this! Learning to "read" it definitely comes with practice.  
\

##### **WHAT DOES THE CODE MAKE?**

There are a couple of types of **outputs** from the above code:

* Data outputs that have been calculated are shown as text outputs.
  + These can also be saved for use later using the backwards arrow `<-` (and we'll learn more about this later). 
* You can also see that the code produces plot outputs as well.

### 1.1.2 Picture & Video

Picture and video content is used to help explain analytical concepts or ideas 
in data, data visualisation and statistics, and to give technical run-throughs.  
\ 

##### **PICTURE**
Here's a GIF of the _Datasaurus rex_, which we'll be coming back to later in the 
course, to understand a certain statistical concept:  
\

</center>  
\  

##### **VIDEO**
Here's a video of what _not_ to do when you get angry with `R`. Because _trust me_,
I know from personal experience that `R` will make you angry at some point, 
and that's ok. Deep breath, walk away.

### 1.1.3 INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS

Interactive content is really important. It will test your 
knowledge as  you work through these worksheets, and inform your home learning.  
\ 

##### **QUIZZES**

Quizzes are multiple choice questions, which will test your knowledge and skills 
in understanding, visualising and analysing data. They may have single answers 
or multiple possible correct answers, as seen below.  
\

```{r qz031, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = " **<** QUIZ 1 (Interactive Elements - quizzes) **>**",
    question("Here's a simple multiple choice question: which of these is the best?",
        answer("Cake", message = "Incorrect. Biscuits rule all. Try dunking some cake in tea or coffee!"),
        answer("Biscuits", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes!!! Biscuits rule all!"),
        answer("Cheesecake", message = "Incorrect. Biscuits rule all. Try dunking some cheesecake in tea or coffee!"),
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("Here's a multiple choice question with more than one answer: which of these are amazing?",
        answer("Tea", correct = TRUE, message = "Tea is amazing."),
        answer("Coffee", correct = TRUE, message = "Coffee is amazing."),
        answer("Fruit tea"),
        answer("None of these"),
        incorrect = "Tea is amazing. Coffee is amazing. Fruit tea is cancelled.",
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("Here's a question which you can retry if you get the answer wrong. Are you excited to learn some R coding???",
        answer("No", message = "...wow. Harsh. Try again."),
        answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "Yeah you are!!!"),
        allow_retry = TRUE,
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    )
)
```
\

##### **EXERCISES**

Exercises are designed to make you better coders, and involve you correcting 
or typing your own R code, which you can run to see a result, or an error, 
depending on whether you have it correct...  
\

#### **<** EXERCISE 1 (Interactive elements - exercises) **>**
_Write the code `6 * 7` in the box below and then click **Run Code** to get the correct answer._  

```{r ex113_1, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

```
```{r ex113_1-hint}
# The answer to life, the universe and everything...
```
\

Sometimes exercises will have **Hints** and/or **Solutions** to help you get to 
the right answer. Take another look at the exercise above and notice that 
there's a "Solution" button, with a solution to completing the exercise.  

The button may sometimes say "Hint", in which case there is a hint to help you, 
rather than a full solution. There may be multiple hints and/or solutions to 
click through!  

It goes without saying to try to complete the exercise _before_ looking at the 
hint or solution. Like any language, coding in `R` requires practice. This is 
the only time I'll instruct you to click the solution button, copy the solution and paste it in the box, 
then click **Run Code** to get the desired figure.  
\  

#### **<** EXERCISE 2 (Interactive elements - exercises) **>**
_Edit the code below to:_ 

1. _Draw 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean of 42 and standard_
_deviation of 12._
2. _Calculate the mean of the distribution._
3. _Calculate the standard deviation of the distribution._  

```{r ex113_2, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# draw random numbers
random <- rnorm(1000, , 12)

# mean
mean(random)

# standard deviation
sd()

```
```{r ex113_2-solution}
# draw random numbers
# 42 is the mean and it is the second argument in rnorm().
random <- rnorm(1000, 42, 12)

# mean
# the function is mean(), not mean_average().
mean(random)

# standard deviation
# add 'random' inside the parentheses.
sd(random)

```
\  

Lots of what we do when coding is taking existing code and adapting it for our 
own needs.

### 1.2 COMPLETING EACH CHAPTER

_There is one chapter per week, starting with **R Basics** in week 1._ 
Each chapter is arranged like this:  
\ 

##### **MAIN CONTENT**
_**MOST SECTIONS OF EACH CHAPTER IS TO BE COMPLETED AT HOME BEFORE EACH ONLINE WORKSHOP.**_  

These first sections of each chapter use code, images, videos, quizzes and exercises for learning
and practicing concepts and skills in R, data, data handling, data visualisation 
and statistics.  
\ 

##### **ONLINE WORKSHOP**
_**THE "ONLINE WORKSHOP" SECTION IS THE LAST SECTION OF EACH CHAPTER AND IS TO BE COMPLETED DURING ONLINE WORKSHOPS.**_  

During these workshops you will be working in your tutor
groups. You'll have some analytical tasks each week to complete, working with 
real biological data to apply the concepts and skills learned in part 1 of the 
chapter. These will all be collated in an R file which will take you through the 
whole analytical process, from start to finish.  


$~$

### 1.3 OTHER RESOURCES

Resources external to this book are also important to the module. A list of 
useful resources will be provided at the top of each Chapter.  
\  

##### **BOOKS**
There are several books that we'll be using throughout the course, and  in the 
spirit of programming, these are all available open source, for free, online. 
Different books will be useful at different parts of the module. 

1. [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
2. [_Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach (2nd ed)_](https://dtkaplan.github.io/SM2-bookdown/) by Daniel Kaplan.
3. [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani.
4. [_Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners (Version 0.6)_](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) by Danielle Navarro.

I also recommend [_Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists (2nd ed)_](http://r4all.org/books/gswr2/) 
by Andrew Beckerman, Dylan Childs, and Owen Petchey, if you're looking to buy a book to help you both now and in the future.  
\  

##### **CHEAT SHEETS**
The RStudio team publish `R` and RStudio cheat sheets which can be really useful 
to refer to, such as this 
[base R cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf) 
and this 
[RStudio cheatsheet](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).
At the top of each chapter will be links to relevant cheatsheets for that chapter.  
\  

##### **ShinyGLM**
I've developed an interactive web app called 
[ShinyGLM](https://iainmstott.shinyapps.io/ShinyGLiM/)
which helps to understand how code and its 
outputs are related to one another. You'll probably use it a fair bit, starting 
from Chapter 2 "Data distributions".  
\  

##### **THE INTERNET**
Data Scientists and statisticians probably spend at least as much time googling as they do writing 
code. If you're having trouble, chances are someone else had the same trouble as 
you: search for the solution to your problem! The skill to find solutions to data and statistics problems is a hugely important part of learning data skills, and will form part of what we learn.  
\

##### **THE FORUM**
Programmers use forums _all the time_, such as 
[RStudio Community](https://community.RStudio.com),
[Stack Overflow](https://stackexchange.com), and 
[GitHub Community](https://github.community).
These forums are places to:

* Ask questions about things you need help understanding.
* Post code that is giving errors.
* Report bugs and errors in resources and software you use.

I have set up a blackboard forum for these purposes. This includes reporting 
any bugs, spelling mistakes or errors in this book. Software isn't a static 
thing, and if there are things that need fixing, then they need fixing!  
\  

##### **EACH OTHER**
Coding is usually a collaborative endeavour. Work with each other: in your 
tutor groups, in your friendship groups, over video chat, via email, in person 
(so long as it's in necessary bubbles, appropriately socially distanced and 
adhering to national and local government guidelines at all times). Share 
knowledge and information 
(_except for the purposes of either of the assessments, which are to be completed individually!_)

### 1.4 THE ANALYTICAL PROCESS

This module is all about analysing data. 
Any analytical process is really just a means of understanding your data, and 
relationships between variables in that data. That's why I do not consider this
to be a "statistics course"; it is a course in giving you many skills to
understand data in many ways. Statistics is one part of that.  
\  

<center>
![The analytical process and its feedbacks](images/Process.png){width="80%"}
</center>  
\  

There is a process to analysis, with a few different steps and feedbacks between 
them, as illustrated above. It's important not to dive right into statistical 
analysis without understanding your data, your variables and the relationships 
between them first. For that reason, much of the course will be dedicated to 
understanding data, and how to plot data.  
\ 

#### **1.5.1 FIRST half of the course (weeks 1-6)**
\ 

##### **TIDY DATA**

* data exploration
* data subsetting
* data manipulation  
\ 

##### **PLOTS**

* Single-variable distributions and summary statistics
* Two- and three-variable plots to explore hypotheses  
\  

Data handling and plotting is also the best vehicle to learn how to 
code: data handling and plots are harder to code but easier to interpret, 
whereas statistical analyses are easier to code but harder to interpret.  
\ 

#### **1.5.2 SECOND half of the course (weeks 8-16)**
\ 

##### **MODEL**

* fitting a statistical model  
\ 

##### **MODEL FIT**

* assessing how well a statistical model fits the data  
\ 

##### **RESULTS**

* Understanding and interpreting the results of a statistical model  
\  

#### **1.5.3 General Linear Model (GLM)**

The "statistical model" we will be working with is the 
_general linear model (glm)_. This is a framework which brings together 
many traditional statistical analyses. You will learn where these traditional 
analyses fit into the glm framework.  

There are naturally feedbacks between these steps, where new information may 
mean you need to revise earlier steps.  
\ 

_In order to be able to achieve this, we're going to need the right software..._

### 1.5 INSTALLING `R` and RSTUDIO
\

**RStudio** is the program (or to give the technical term, an 
"Integrated Development Environment" or _IDE_), which we'll be using to code 
in a `R`. The very first thing you need to do is install both of 
these. The following video walks you through installation and briefly explains 
the difference between the two.
