## 0 --- Data
\

This page introduces the data sets you'll be using during the course.  
\

The _**GAMES**_ data will be used during pre-session home-working part of each Chapter, and will be used to help learn theory and skills in data handling, visualisation and analysis.  
\

The _**BIOLOGICAL DATA SETS**_ will be used to apply data theory and skills to real, published biological data sets, during online workshops.  

$~$

### **--- GAMES DATA**
\ 

#### _The **GAMES** data is a data set you'll use during the home-working part of each Chapter._  
\

The data is based on some simple games/tests and basic information about yourselves. You'll be asked to fill this out during the first lecture for the module. Please look at the information below and fill in the form at the end of this seection. The data is stored anonymously.  

$~$

#### **VARIABLES IN THE GAMES DATA**
\

1. **ROLE**, saved as `role` in the data, is one of:

* _student_ at Lincoln (coded as `student` in the data)
* _staff_ at Lincoln (coded as `staff` in the data)
* _external_ to Lincoln (coded as `external` in the data)
* _child_ (coded as `child` in the data)
* _baby_ (coded as `baby` in the data)

2. **EYESIGHT**: your **glasses prescription** (if any). 
If you have a different prescription for 
each eye then take the average.
Saved as `eyesight` in the data.

3. **CONTINENTS**: how many continents you've visited in your life (
including your home continent).
Saved as `continents` in the data.

4. **COUNTRIES**: how many countries you've visited in your life 
(including your home country).
Saved as `countries` in the data-

5. **HEARING**: your score in the hearing test (see below).
Saved as `hearing` in the data.

6. **REACTION** your score in the reaction test (see below). 
Saved as `reaction` in the data.

7. **HARDWARE**, saved as `hardware` in the data, is whether for the two games above, you were using a:

* mouse (coded as `mouse` in the data)
* touchpad or touchscreen (coded as `touch` in the data)  

$~$

##### **HIGH FREQUENCY HEARING TEST**

For the following test you'll need speakers or earphones. Please make sure that the volume is not turned up too loud!  

Once you click, a noise will be produced, starting from 20000Hz and decreasing. You need to click again as soon as you hear the noise. Younger people tend to be able to hear higher frequencies.  

If, for whatever reason, you are unable to take the test, please skip this question.  
\

   <iframe width="360" height="540" src="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
   </iframe>
</div>

$~$

##### **REACTION TEST**

This reaction test will measure your reaction time three times; please record the average time in the form. Note: although the test involves clicking when a colour turns from red to green, the test is still suitable for those with any kind of colour blindness as the prompt will change from "Wait for green" to "Click!"

### **--- BIOLOGICAL DATA**
\

#### _The **BIOLOGICAL** data consists of data sets that you'll work on in online workshops_.  
\

#### _**EACH GROUP WILL WORK ON ONE OF THE DATA SETS:**_

* **GROUP 1** (timetabled as BM/BV/BCB1, Tuesdays 17:00-18:00): **CELLULAR AGEING**
* **GROUP 2** (timetabled as BM/BV/BCB2, Wednesdays 16:00-17:00): **CELLULAR AGEING**
* **GROUP 3** (timetabled as BM/BV/BCB3, Wednesdays 17:00-18:00): **CELLULAR AGEING**
* **GROUP 4** (timetabled as EQS/Z/BIO, Fridays 16:00-17:00): **URBAN DOGS**
* **GROUP 5** (timetabled as ECL/Z/BIO, Mondays 17:00-18:00): **CARNIVORE LIFE HISTORY**
\

There are three data sets, each focused on different levels of the hierarchy of biological organisation. In the modern age, it is becoming more common to publish scientific research and data "open access", which is essentially a form of creative commons license for science. This usually allows the unrestricted use and redistribution of the work, provided it is cited. All three data sets are freely available online in data archives, and all three research articles are also open-access.  
\

#### **CELLULAR AGEING**

[Huh _et al._ (2016) Maintenance of age in human neurons generated by microRNA-based neuronal conversion of fibroblasts. _eLife_, 5:e18648. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.18648.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/18648)  
\

<center>
![Neurons](www/neurons.jpg){width="80%"}
</center>  
\  

When studying old age brain disorders, it is difficult to get samples of the affected cells. New techniques mean it is possible to instead convert fibroblast cells (from the skin) into neurons using an approach termed "microRNA-based cellular reprogramming", but it's important that the converted neurons behave as if they're the same 'age' as their parent fibroblasts . This article measures a number of aspects of cellular age to determine whether or not that is the case.  

The variables are:

* `SampleNo`: the sample number
* `Donor`: the donor ID
* `DNAmAge`: the cell age (measured by applying an epigenetic biomarker to DNA methylation data).
* `Tissue` The tissue type
  + `fibroblasts`, the pre-conversion fibroblast cells
  + `neuron`, the post-conversion medium spiny neuron cells.
* `Age` the age of the donor
* `Gender` the gender identity of the donor
  + `male`
  + `female`
\

The file for this data is called `cell_age_data.csv`.  
\

#### **URBAN DOGS**

[Majumder _et al._ (2016) Denning habits of free-ranging dogs reveal preference for human proximity. _Scientific Reports_, 6:32014. DOI: 10.1038/srep32014.](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32014)  
\

<center>
![Sleepy dog](www/dog.jpg){width="80%"}
</center>  
\  

In urban settings, it is common for mammals to build their dens away from human activity, but dogs have evolved in the presence of humans. It is unclear then, what governs the choices of den site for feral dogs in urban landscapes versus rural. This study follows 148 dogs in India and scores dens on a number of characteristics to determine whether urban and rural dogs are making similar den choices.  

The variables are:

* `Year`: the year of the study
* `Mother`: the ID of the mother of the litter
* `LitterSize`: the size of the litter 
* `LitterSizeCategory`: the size of the litter as a categorical variable
  + `small`, 1-4 pups
  + `large`, > 4 pups
* `TotalScore`: the total score for den quality across all criteria
* `StructureScore`: the score for den structure (den area, height, level i.e. above or below ground)
* `ResourceScore`: the score for access to resources (distance to food and water)
* `QualityScore`: the score for den quality (shade and light availability)
* `DisturbanceScore`: the level of human disturbances.

(More information on scoring is available in the supplementary material for the article).
\

The file for this data is called `urban_dogs_data.csv`.  
\

#### **CARNIVORE LIFE HISTORY**
\
[Jones _et al._ (2009) PanTHERIA: a species-level database of life history, ecology, and geography of extant and recently extinct mammals. _Ecology_, **90**, 2648. DOI: 10.1890/08-1494.1.](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-1494.1)  
\

<center>
![Mammal skull](www/skull.jpg){width="80%"}
</center>  
\  

The PANTHERIA data base (_pan_ = all-encompassing; _theria_ = the group formed of most extant mammals) is an open-access data base of mammal life history and ecology data. Life history refers to timings of events in an organism's life, such as age at reproductive maturity, reproductive rate, longevity, etc., and ecological data encompasses anything to do with an organism's environment and interactions with other species. Data bases like this one are often used to conduct macro-ecological and macro-evolutionary (and macro-eco-evolutionary) studies; looking at how species and their life forms have evolved according to their lineages and ecologies. This subset of the data is for the carnivores.  

The variables are:

* `Family`: the species' Family, e.g. Felidae (cats), Otariidae (eared seals), Ursidae (bears)...
* `Genus`: the Genus
* `Species`: the Species (binomial)
* `AdultBodyMass`: Average adult body mass in grams
* `BasalMetabolicRate`: basal metabolic rate in millilitres of oxygen per hour
* `LitterSize`: the average litter size
* `LittersPerYear`: the average number of litters per year
* `GestationLength`: the gestation length in days
* `MaxLongevity`: the maximum known longevity in days
* `SexualMaturity`: the average age at sexual maturity in days
* `TrophicLevel`: the trophic level
  + `1`, `2`, or `3`
\

The file for this data is called `pantheria_data.csv`.

### 1.1 --- THIS BOOK

First, some information on this web book.  
\ 

The book accompanies every student for 
the first 9 weeks of the module, after which the teaching and content start
to diverge for different programmes. This divergence allows programmes to learn 
analytical techniques which are relevant to their courses: some stay with 
content in this book, and some do not.  
\  

Here's a quick video tutorial on the layout of this book, and how it 
functions.

### CONTENT TYPES

Within the book you will find a diversity of content, which we'll go through 
in the next sections.  
\  


### 1.1.1 --- `R` Code

We are learning how to visualise, manage and analyse data in `R`. `R` is a 
**programming language**, and people who use it are variously called "programmers", 
"coders" or "developers".  
\

##### **Why R?**

You may have come across other programs that allow you to work with data, 
plot data and run statistical analyses. So why a programming language, and 
_why R?_  
\ 

##### **WHAT IS `R`?**
_Think of_ `R` _as a language_ you're writing in. 
"Running" R code from within a file allows you 
to communicate with the computer and instruct it to do something, 
resulting in outputs like plots or data.  
\ 

##### **WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF USING `R`?**

There are a _huge number of benefits to using R_, listed here and elaborated on in the video below.

1. It's **_free_**.
2. It's **_open source_**.
3. It's **_cross-platform_**.
4. It's **_transparent_** and **_replicable_**.
5. It's **_powerful_** and **_fast_**.
6. It's **_flexible_**.
7. It makes you **_employable_**.  
\ 

<center>
![](https://youtu.be/sbymgGb06Tc){width="80%"}
</center>
\  


##### **WHAT IS RSTUDIO?**
We will be working with `R` in a program called **RStudio**; think of this like 
`R`'s Microsoft Word; i.e. a program that allows you to create, save and open `R` code
files; to edit those files and write `R` code. RStudio enables you to run `R` 
code, and get whatever output you need, whether it's a calculation, a subset 
of data, or a graph, for example.  
\ 

This video explains some of these concepts:  
\

</center>
\  
\  

##### **WHAT DOES `R` CODE LOOK LIKE?**

`R` often seems scary when you first 
encounter it, but as outlined in the _R Basics_ chapter, thinking of it like 
a language can help. As with learning a language, practise makes perfect. 
\ 

First of all, `R` code is always written in a `fixed width font`, where every 
character has the same width. This way it's easier to read, as the characters align 
vertically from line to line.  Short pieces of code may be written as `inline code`. 
Longer pieces of code (especially if they run over multiple lines) are written as a 
**code chunk**. Here's an example:  

```{r}
# draw random numbers
random <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)

# plot distribution
ggplot(as.data.frame(random), aes(x = random)) + 
    geom_density()

# mean
mean(random)

# standard deviation
sd(random)
```
\  

##### **WHAT DOES THE ABOVE CODE DO?**

1. Draws 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and 
standard deviation of 1.
2. Plots thie distribution of these numbers (this should look roughly like 
a normal-distribution-bell-curve).
3. Calculates the mean of the distribution (which should be close to zero)
4. Calculates the standard deviation of the distribution (which should be 
close to 1).
5. Any lines which start with `#` are _comments_: anything after the # symbol is ignored and not run as code. This means you can keep a commentary alongside your code, detailing what it does.  
\

##### **HOW CAN I "READ" THE CODE?**  

This is something that takes practice. Chapter 1 'R Basics' will help understand the vocabulary and grammar of `R` code. When understanding `R` code, most of the time you have to think relatively logically and apply a little common sense. Like reading any language, it takes practice!  

The paragraph below walks you through interpreting some elements of the above code chunk  

Take a look at the code, including the _comments_ (lines beginning with `#`, as explained above).
Certain elements might start to match up. For example, 
`rnorm` could mean "random normal". `1000` is how many random normal numbers we want, 
`0` is the mean, and `1` is the standard deviation. It makes sense then, that putting them together using 
`rnorm(1000, 0, 1)` calculates the data we want for step one of the above list: 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The 
next part uses `ggplot` and `geom_density`, so that has something 
to do with making a density plot (step 2). `mean` must calculate the mean
(step 3), and `sd` must calculate the standard deviation (step 4). The values of these can be seen below the lines that calculate them.  
\

You'll get to learn the specifics with time. `R` is _very_ literal and logical: you'll become used to this! Learning to "read" it definitely comes with practice.  
\

##### **WHAT DOES THE CODE MAKE?**

There are a couple of types of **outputs** from the above code chunk:

* Data outputs that have been calculated are shown as text outputs.
  + These can be saved for use later by 'assigning' the values to objects using the backwards arrow `<-`. We see that in the above code for the object `random`, and we'll learn more about this process later. 
* You can also see that the code produces plot outputs as well.
* Data and plots are probably the primary outputs `R` makes, but the possibilities are endless: spatial data, interfacing with online databases and servers   


$~$

### 1.1.2 --- Picture & Video

Picture and video content is used to help explain analytical concepts or ideas 
in data, data visualisation and statistics, and to give technical run-throughs.  
\ 

##### **PICTURE**
Here's a GIF of the _Datasaurus rex_, which we'll be coming back to later in the 
course, to understand a certain statistical concept:  
\ 

<center>
![Datasaurus rex](www/datasaurus_dozen.gif){width="60%"}
</center>  
\  

##### **VIDEO**
Here's a video of what _not_ to do when you get angry with `R`. Because _trust me_,
I know from personal experience that `R` will make you angry at some point, 
and that's ok. Deep breath, walk away.

$~$

### 1.1.3 --- INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS

Interactive content is really important. It will test your 
knowledge as  you work through these worksheets, and inform your home learning.  
\ 

##### **QUIZZES**

Quizzes are multiple choice questions, which will test your knowledge and skills 
in understanding, visualising and analysing data. They may have single answers 
or multiple possible correct answers, as seen below.  
\

```{r qz031, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = " **< QUIZ 1 >** (Interactive Elements - quizzes)",
    question("Here's a simple multiple choice question: which of these is the best?",
        answer("Cake", message = "Incorrect. Biscuits rule all. Try dunking some cake in tea or coffee!"),
        answer("Biscuits", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes!!! Biscuits rule all!"),
        answer("Cheesecake", message = "Incorrect. Biscuits rule all. Try dunking some cheesecake in tea or coffee!"),
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("Here's a multiple choice question with more than one answer: which of these are amazing?",
        answer("Tea", correct = TRUE, message = "Tea is amazing."),
        answer("Coffee", correct = TRUE, message = "Coffee is amazing."),
        answer("Fruit tea"),
        answer("None of these"),
        incorrect = "Tea is amazing. Coffee is amazing. Fruit tea is cancelled.",
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("Here's a question which you can retry if you get the answer wrong. Are you excited to learn some R coding???",
        answer("No", message = "...wow. Harsh. Try again."),
        answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "Yeah you are!!!"),
        allow_retry = TRUE,
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    )
)
```
\

##### **EXERCISES**

Exercises are designed to make you better coders, and involve you correcting 
or typing your own R code, which you can run to see a result, or an error, 
depending on whether you have it correct...  
\

#### **< EXERCISE 1 >** (Interactive elements - exercises)
_Write the code `6 * 7` in the box below and then click **Run Code** to get the correct answer._  

```{r ex113_1, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

```
```{r ex113_1-hint}
# The answer to life, the universe and everything...
```
\

Sometimes exercises will have **Hints** and/or **Solutions** to help you get to 
the right answer. Take another look at the exercise above and notice that 
there's a "Solution" button, with a solution to completing the exercise.  

The button may sometimes say "Hint", in which case there is a hint to help you, 
rather than a full solution. There may be multiple hints and/or solutions to 
click through!  

It goes without saying to try to complete the exercise _before_ looking at the 
hint or solution. Like any language, coding in `R` requires practice. This is 
the only time I'll instruct you to click the solution button, copy the solution and paste it in the box, 
then click **Run Code** to get the desired figure.  
\  

#### **< EXERCISE 2 >** (Interactive elements - exercises)
_Edit the code below to:_ 

1. _Draw 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean of 42 and standard_
_deviation of 12._
2. _Calculate the mean of the distribution._
3. _Calculate the standard deviation of the distribution._  

_Remove the hash `#` from the start of each line first._

```{r ex113_2, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# draw random numbers
random <- rnorm(1000, , 12)

# mean
mean(random)

# standard deviation
sd()

```
```{r ex113_2-solution}
# draw random numbers
# 42 is the mean and it is the second argument in rnorm().
random <- rnorm(1000, 42, 12)

# mean
# the function is mean(), not mean_average().
mean(random)

# standard deviation
# add 'random' inside the parentheses.
sd(random)

```
\  

Lots of what we do when coding is taking existing code and adapting it for our 
own needs.

***
### 1.2 --- COMPLETING EACH CHAPTER

_There is one chapter per week, starting with **R Basics** in week 1._ 
Each chapter is arranged like this:  
\ 

##### **MAIN CONTENT**
_**MOST SECTIONS OF EACH CHAPTER IS TO BE COMPLETED AT HOME BEFORE EACH ONLINE WORKSHOP.**_  

These first sections of each chapter use code, images, videos, quizzes and exercises for learning
and practicing concepts and skills in R, data, data handling, data visualisation 
and statistics.  
\ 

##### **ONLINE WORKSHOP**
_**THE "ONLINE WORKSHOP" SECTION IS THE LAST SECTION OF EACH CHAPTER AND IS TO BE COMPLETED DURING ONLINE WORKSHOPS.**_  

During these workshops you will be working in your tutor
groups. You'll have some analytical tasks each week to complete, working with 
real biological data to apply the concepts and skills learned in part 1 of the 
chapter. These will all be collated in an R file which will take you through the 
whole analytical process, from start to finish.  


$~$

### 1.3 OTHER RESOURCES

Resources external to this book are also important to the module. A list of 
useful resources will be provided at the top of each Chapter.  
\  

##### **BOOKS**
There are several books that we'll be using throughout the course, and  in the 
spirit of programming, these are all available open source, for free, online. 
Different books will be useful at different parts of the module. 

1. [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
2. [_Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach (2nd ed)_](https://dtkaplan.github.io/SM2-bookdown/) by Daniel Kaplan.
3. [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani.
4. [_Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners (Version 0.6)_](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) by Danielle Navarro.

I also recommend [_Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists (2nd ed)_](http://r4all.org/books/gswr2/) 
by Andrew Beckerman, Dylan Childs, and Owen Petchey, if you're looking to buy a book to help you both now and in the future.  
\  

##### **CHEAT SHEETS**
The RStudio team publish `R` and RStudio cheat sheets which can be really useful 
to refer to, such as this 
[base R cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf) 
and this 
[RStudio cheatsheet](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).
At the top of each chapter will be links to relevant cheatsheets for that chapter.  
\  

##### **ShinyGLM**
I've developed an interactive web app called 
[ShinyGLM](https://iainmstott.shinyapps.io/ShinyGLiM/)
which helps to understand how code and its 
outputs are related to one another. You'll probably use it a fair bit, starting 
from Chapter 2 "Data distributions".  
\  

##### **THE INTERNET**
Data Scientists and statisticians probably spend at least as much time googling as they do writing 
code. If you're having trouble, chances are someone else had the same trouble as 
you: search for the solution to your problem! The skill to find solutions to data and statistics problems is a hugely important part of learning data skills, and will form part of what we learn.  
\

##### **FORUMS**
Programmers use forums _all the time_, such as 
[RStudio Community](https://community.RStudio.com),
[Stack Overflow](https://stackexchange.com), and 
[GitHub Community](https://github.community).
These forums are places to:

* Ask questions about things you need help understanding.
* Post code that is giving errors.
* Report bugs and errors in resources and software you use.

I will set up channels on Teams for you to ask and answer questions, share useful tips, and solve issues. This includes reporting 
any bugs, spelling mistakes or errors in this book. I'll moderate the content and try and solve outstanding issues a couple of times a week. I encourage you to participate in this though, it's great to collaborate on these sorts of things, and that is how coding is done in the real world. I can update this book and apps online if need be: software isn't a static 
thing, and if there are things that need fixing, then they need fixing!  
\  

##### **EACH OTHER**
Coding is usually a collaborative endeavour. Work with each other: in your 
tutor groups, in your friendship groups, over video chat, via email, in person 
(so long as it's in necessary bubbles, appropriately socially distanced and 
adhering to national and local government guidelines at all times). Share 
knowledge and information 
(_except for the purposes of either of the assessments, which are to be completed individually!_)

### 1.4 THE ANALYTICAL PROCESS

This module is all about analysing data. 
Any analytical process is really just a means of understanding your data, and 
relationships between variables in that data. That's why I do not consider this
to be a "statistics course"; it is a course in giving you many skills to
understand data in many ways. Statistics is one part of that.  
\  

<center>
![The analytical process and its feedbacks](www/Process.png){width="80%"}
</center>  
\  

There is a process to analysis, with a few different steps and feedbacks between 
them, as illustrated above. It's important not to dive right into statistical 
analysis without understanding your data, your variables and the relationships 
between them first. For that reason, much of the course will be dedicated to 
understanding data, and how to plot data.  
\ 

#### **1.5.1 FIRST half of the course (weeks 1-6)**
\ 

##### **TIDY DATA**

* data exploration
* data subsetting
* data manipulation  
\ 

##### **PLOTS**

* Single-variable distributions and summary statistics
* Two- and three-variable plots to explore hypotheses  
\  

Data handling and plotting is also the best vehicle to learn how to 
code: data handling and plots are harder to code but easier to interpret, 
whereas statistical analyses are easier to code but harder to interpret.  
\ 

#### **1.5.2 SECOND half of the course (weeks 8-16)**
\ 

##### **MODEL**

* fitting a statistical model  
\ 

##### **MODEL FIT**

* assessing how well a statistical model fits the data  
\ 

##### **RESULTS**

* Understanding and interpreting the results of a statistical model  
\  

#### **1.5.3 General Linear Model (GLM)**

The "statistical model" we will be working with (mostly) is the 
_general linear model (glm)_. This is a framework which brings together 
many traditional statistical analyses. You will learn where these traditional 
analyses fit into the glm framework.  

There are naturally feedbacks between the steps of the analytical process, where new information may mean you need to revise earlier steps (hence the backwards arrows).  
\ 

_In order to be able to achieve this, we're going to need the right software..._

### 1.5 INSTALLING `R` and RSTUDIO
\

**RStudio** is the program (or to give the technical term, an 
"Integrated Development Environment" or _IDE_), which we'll be using to code 
in a `R`. The very first thing you need to do is install both of 
these. I suggest the link below to guide you through installing `R` and RStudio: it covers Windows, Mac and Linux.

### LEARNING SCHEDULE
\

Below is a diagram of the learning schedule (you can find a pdf copy on blackboard also).

* The top row shows the timings of **ASSESSMENTS**. Detailed information can be found on blackboard in the "Assessments" folder: there is one pdf file for each assessment, called "Assessment Briefings".
  + An online Multiple Choice Questionnaire must be completed on _Friday 27th October (week 7)_.
  + A data analysis report must be handed in on or before _Wednesday 27th January (week 16)_.
* The **SCHEDULE** has one row for each programme, and shows the topics covered for each programme, week-by-week. Everyone takes takes the same topics until week 9, after which the teaching and content start to diverge for different programmes. This divergence allows programmes to learn analytical techniques which are relevant to their courses.
* The **STAFF** section shows which staff are teaching in which weeks, topic-by-topic.

## 2 --- R Basics
\

Welcome to your first R tutorial! In this tutorial we'll be covering the very basics of R, which is a programming language originally developed for 
understanding data and doing statistics. This tutorial includes:  

* `R` packages
* the anatomy ("vocabulary" and "grammar") of R code
* objects
   + assignment to objects
   + object classes
* functions
   + function arguments
* outputs
* code comments
* loading data into `R`  
\
* What programming languages are
  + types of programming language
  + the anatomy ("vocabulary" and "grammar") of R code
* What RStudio is, and how RStudio works with R
* The structure of R
  + base R packages
  + add-on R packages
* Reading data into `R`.  
\  

With this information, we'll put our newfound knowledge into practice and 
do some basic coding in R to get used to this new way of working with data. If 
you're familiar with R already, this should still serve as a 
useful reminder!

### **2.2 R PACKAGES**
\

Lots of things can be done with what is called _base R_, 
which is a set of R functions and tools that load every time you start R 
(and therefore every time you start RStudio, as R is run from within RStudio).  

Some tasks require add-on _R packages_ with 
extra functions and tools. Think of these like dictionaries of extra vocabulary 
and grammar which allow R to communicate with the computer in more elaborate ways.  
\ 

This video explains briefly how `R` packages work:

$~$

##### **IMPORTANT: TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT**

In this module, we'll be using a collection of packages, built by RStudio, collectively called the
[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) (although we'll only be using a 
few of the ones that are on offer).  

The tidyverse is a new, emerging way of working with and visualising data 
in `R`. It's fast becoming a standard way of coding, although some old-schoolers
have taken a while to get used to it*. I'll often refer to it as the 'new', 'modern' 
or 'contemporary' way of doing things, simply because it was born in the last 
few years.  

An alternative way of working with data and data visualisation is using 
base `R`, and many people still do. This has been around since the inception 
of `R`. I'll often refer to it as the 'old' or 'traditional' way of doing 
things, simply because it has been around longer.  

There is no one 'correct' way of doing things. I use a mix of the two for my research, 
as do many people, and in fact it's almost impossible to use the tidyverse 
approach without using some base `R`.  
Many of your lecturers that use `R` will work only in base `R`.  

We're using the _tidyverse_ in this module as it generally has a more coherent 
approach to coding, and because it's easier to do more powerful things more 
quickly.  
\

Even I was one of those old-schoolers until just over a year ago!

### **2.3 THE ANATOMY, VOCABULARY AND GRAMMAR OF `R` CODE**
\

There are 6 key components to `R`code: **objects**, **assignment**, **functions**, **arguments**, **outputs** and **comments**.  
\

<center>
![](https://youtu.be/A40B5lelYpY){width="80%"}
</center>
\  

##### **OBJECTS**
R is used for _Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)_. This means that when coding 
in R, you create **objects**, which are packets of data saved in the 
computer's RAM. These objects can be recalled and used throughout that R 
session, until they are either overwritten or removed.  

Think of it like filling a weekend bag full of things: your bag is full of 
objects ready to use; your `R` session is also full of objects ready for you 
to use.  
\

##### **CLASSES**
These objects have different **classes**, which define
what the object is and how `R` works with it. `R` will work with objects 
differently, depending on their class: for example, it is possible to calculate 
the mean of some numbers, but it's not possible to calculate a mean of some words!  

Similarly, you might have two similar-looking objects in your weekend bag, but 
their "class" would mean you use them in unique ways. Your toothbrush and your 
hairbrush are both brushes, but you (presumably) use them differently.  
\

##### **FUNCTIONS** AND **ASSIGNING**
Objects are usually created using **functions**. These create or process data 
in some way and save it to the RAM (like putting something in the bag). The 
way this is done is using an **assigning arrow** `<-`. The object goes on the 
left, and the function on the right.  
`answer <- 6 * 7`  
\

The next sections go into greater depth on these topics.  

$~$

***
### **2.4 OBJECTS**
\

This section covers how to create objects, what classes mean, what functions 
are and how they work.  

Objects are created using **functions**. Simple functions include `+ - * /`, 
only one of which is not an Ed Sheeran album.  
\

#### **< EXERCISE 1 >** Objects
_Use the functions `+ - * /` to:_

1. _Choose any number_
2. _Add the next highest integer number_
3. _Add 9_
4. _Divide by 2_
4. _Subtract your original number_

_Hint: don't forget the order of operations: `*` and `/` are executed before `+` and `-`! Parentheses `( )` can help group the right operations._
```{r ex24_1, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

```
```{r ex24_1-solution}
# If your number is 42
((42 + 43 + 9) / 2) - 42

# Whatever number you chose, your answer is 5.
```
\

More complicated functions take the form 
`function(argument1, argument2, ...)`. Each function has its own specific
set of arguments, and a different object is created depending on what 
these arguments are.
```{r}
numbers <- seq(1, 10, 1)
numbers
```

The function `seq()` means "sequence". This sequence is the integer numbers 
starting at 1 and ending at 10.  
\

We can do certain things with this vector. For example, we might want to see a 
summary about it, find out what its length is, calculate the mean or see the 
first 5 elements:
```{r}
summary(numbers)
length(numbers)
mean(numbers)
numbers[1:5]
```
\

In this case `1:5` does the same thing as `seq(1, 5, 1)`. There are often many 
ways to get any single output in `R`, in the same way that there are often 
many different ways to say one thing in a spoken language.  
\

We can change or add arguments to make a function behave differently. For example,
adding an argument _digits_ to the `summary()` function gives the results to 
a certain number of decimal places.
```{r}
summary(numbers, digits = 1)
```
\

Going back to the original creation of the `numbers` object, we can change the 
arguments of `seq` to create a different object: the two-times-table up to 20.
```{r}
numbers2 <- seq(2, 20, 2)
numbers2
```
\

#### **< EXERCISE 2 >** Objects
_Create an object called `numbers3` which is a sequence_ 
_of numbers from 3 to 21, in steps of 2._
```{r ex24_2, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

```
```{r ex24_2-solution}
seq(3, 21, 2)
```

As we have `numbers2` and `numbers3`, maybe we should be consistent and change 
the name of `numbers` to `numbers1`. We can do that by creating a new object and 
removing the old one:
```{r}
numbers1 <- numbers
rm(numbers)
```
\

We created `numbers1` from another object `numbers`. In fact, you can
create object using multiple other objects, and objects can be created in 
different ways.
```{r}
# We could create numbers2 by multiplying numbers1 by 2
numbers1 * 2

# We could add 1 to every number in numbers2
numbers2 + 1

# We could add together numbers1 and numbers2
numbers1 + numbers2
```
\

Note how `R` processes objects: both `numbers1` and `numbers2` have 10 individual 
numbers (termed _elements_ of the vector), 
so `R` adds the two first elements, the two second elements, the two third elements, 
etc. If we provide `R` with fewer than 10 elements, then it recycles the shorter 
vector: so if we add `1` to `numbers1` then it adds 1 to every element.  
\  

```{r qz24_1, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "**< QUIZ 1 >** (Objects)",
    question("What do the three arguments of the seq() function mean (in order)?",
        answer("start of sequence, length of sequence, sequence increment"),
        answer("start of sequence, end of sequence, length of sequence"),
        answer("start of sequence, end of sequence, sequence increment", correct = TRUE),
        incorrect = "start, end, increment.",
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("how could you find the mean of the numeric vector `c(5, 6, 7, 8)`? Choose all answers that apply.",
        answer("`mean(c(5, 6, 7, 8))`", correct = TRUE),
        answer("`mean(5:8)`", correct = TRUE),
        answer("`summary(5:8)`", correct = TRUE),
        answer("`(5 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 4`", correct = TRUE),
        incorrect = "These are all different routes to the same answer.",
        random_answer_order = TRUE,
        allow_retry = TRUE
    )
)
```

$~$

***
### **2.5 OBJECT CLASSES**
\

Objects always have a **class** which defines how `R` processes and interacts with 
them. There are 5 different class types that it's important to know at this point.

* **numeric**
* **character**
* **factor**
* **logical**
* **data.frame**

$~$

### 2.5.1 `numeric`
\

The objects `numbers1`, `numbers2` and `numbers3` have the class _numeric_: 
this means a set (called a _vector_) of 
numbers. You can see that the class of `numbers1` is numeric using the function 
`class()`:
```{r}
class(numbers1)
```
\

We have already seen a fair bit of how numeric vectors are processed by `R`.  
\


### 2.5.2 `character`
\

We'll create a new object which looks kinda like `numbers1`, but is
not actually the same.
```{r}
characters1 <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10")
characters1
```
\

The `c()` function is really important. It means "concatenate", and basically 
glues together the arguments you give it. The `characters1` object 
looks similar to the `numbers1` object, but it's not. Note the quote marks 
around each vector element.  
\

#### **< EXERCISE 3 >** Classes - `character`
_Find out the class of `characters1`._
```{r ex252_3, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
characters1 <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10")

```
```{r ex252_3-solution}
# the answer is 'character'.
class(characters1)
```

Let's try and find the same information about `characters1` as we did for `numbers1`.
```{r}
summary(characters1)
length(characters1)
mean(characters1)
characters1[1:5]
```
\

One of these functions went kinda wrong. As far as R is concerned, the 
elements of `characters1` are words, and it can't calculate the mean of some 
words. It returns `NA`, meaning "Not Applicable": R language for something which 
doesn't exist or is missing.  

The _Warning_ message makes sure you're aware that
the code did run and give an output, but something probably went wrong.  

R can also return an _Error_ message, which tells you that
the function has failed to run at all, and gave no output.  

_Pay attention to these messages_: usually if you get 
an Error or a Warning, much of your subsequent code will fail as it depends
on things being calculated properly.  
\

It's possible to convert things between different classes, although the 
behaviour is sometimes unpredictable so be careful!
```{r}
characters2 <- as.character(numbers2)
characters2
```
\


### 2.5.3 `factor`
\

A **factor** object is like a character object, but recognises groups of elements
which are the same, called _levels_. Let's take a look:
```{r}
factor1 <- rep(LETTERS[1:5], 2)
factor1 <- as.factor(factor1)
factor1
```
\

The object `LETTERS` is a character object which already exists in `R` without us having 
to create it. Note that it has to be LETTERS in capitals: `R` is case-sensitive, 
which means the code won't work if you have a lower-case letter rather than 
an upper-case letter or vice versa. This is a really common mistake to make and 
easy to miss!  

We use the square brackets to choose which letters we
want: we choose A, B, C, D and E, which are the first 5 letters of the alphabet.  

The `rep` function means repeat, so we repeat A to E two times, to give a vector 
that has a length of 10.  

Finally, we convert that character vector to a factor using `as.factor()` and 
overwrite the original `factor1` object by reassigning it.
```{r}
summary(factor1)
```

We can see from the summary that R recognises the five different factor levels,
A through E.  
\

```{r qz253_3, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = " **< QUIZ 3 >** (Classes - `factor`)",
    question("What is the fundamental difference between a character vector and a factor vector?",
        answer("A factor vector excludes quotation marks and a character vector doesn't."),
        answer("A factor vector can be used in a data frame", message = "Both character vectors and factor vectors can be used in data frames."),
        answer("A factor vector has defined 'levels' that values can take", correct = TRUE),
        answer("A factor vector and a character vector are the same."),
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("What are character and factor vectors each best used for?",
        answer("character: unique information for each data row; factor: shared information across rows", correct = TRUE),
        answer("character: shared information across rows; factor: unique information for each data row"),
        answer("It doesn't matter"),
        message = "As factors recognise defined 'levels' of information (equal to categories), they're well-suited to data where information is shared across rows of the data frame (e.g. colours of cars), whereas character vectors are better for data where every row represents something unique (e.g. names of people driving cars)",
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    )
)
```

$~$

### 2.5.4 `logical`
\

Logical objects are perhaps hard to understand at first, but they're simple
really. They basically indicate whether something is `TRUE` or `FALSE`. They
usually relate to a question we ask of our data.
```{r}
rand_norm <- rnorm(50, 0, 1)
rand_norm
over0 <- rand_norm > 0
over0
```

The result is information on which of your random data are greater than than 0.  
\

```{r qz254_4, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "**< QUIZ 4 >** (Classes - `logical`)",
    question("If you ran the above code multiple times, would you get the same result each time?",
        answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
        answer("No"),
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    ),

    question("You won't get the same result each time. Which part of the code causes that to happen?",
        answer("the function rnorm()", correct = TRUE, message = "The function rnorm() creates random numbers."),
        answer("The arguments 50, 0, 1", message = "The function rnorm() creates random numbers."),
        answer("The logical operator >", message = "The function rnorm() creates random numbers."),
        random_answer_order = TRUE
    )
)
```
\

There are lots of questions you can ask of your data using logical operators, and 
you will encounter many on your R journey e.g. 

* `>` greater than 
* `>=` greater than or equal to
* `<` less than
* `<=` less than or equal to  

These behave in exactly the way you would expect given how you've already seen 
`>` works.  

Logical operators (and `R` in general) don't always behave in the way you might 
expect, however. Take these logical operators:

* `==` exactly equal to
* `!=` not equal to

`==` tells you whether the two objects on the left and the right are exactly equal 
to each other:

```{r}
1 == 1
c(1, 1, 2, 3) == 1

# using some objects we created earlier in the chapter:
numbers2 == numbers1 * 2
numbers1 == characters1
```

We might not expect `numbers1 == characters1` to return all `TRUE`. All I can say is... sometimes `R` is weird.  
\

`!=` does the opposite job of `==`, telling us which elements on the right are NOT the same as the element(s) on the left.  
\
```{r}
1 != 1
"ABC" != "ABCDEFG"
```
\

One final useful logical operator:

* `%in%` tells you which elements of one vector belong to another vector.
\

`%in%` is used to find out whether a value or values in one vector
(on the left) exist in another vector (on the right). For example:
```{r}
c(1, 2, 3) %in% c(1, 2)
numbers2 %in% numbers1
```
It's not necessary when using `%in%` for the two vectors to have the same length; in the first line of code, we compare a vector with three elements to a vector with two elements.  

We interpret the results like this: if `numbers2 %in% numbers1` is `TRUE` then the corresponding element of `numbers2`
is found somewhere in `numbers1`. If `FALSE`, it isn't. We can see that the first 5 elements of `numbers2` are found in `numbers1`.  
\

Logicals are very useful for subsetting data:
```{r}
num2_in_num1 <- numbers2 %in% numbers1
numbers2[num2_in_num1]
```
We first create an object that tells us which elements of `numbers2` are in `numbers1`. Then, when `num2_in_num1` is put in the square brackets, it 
picks out all the elements of `numbers2` which are `TRUE`: 
these are the values of numbers in `numbers2` which are also found somewhere in `numbers1`.  
\

#### **< EXERCISE 4 >** Classes - `logical`
_Put in the correct logical operators. The correct outputs are found in the solutions._
```{r ex254_4, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# 1. ((42 + 43 + 9) / 2) - 42 is the same as ((31 + 32 + 9) / 2) - 31
((42 + 43 + 9) / 2) - 42     ((31 + 32 + 9) / 2) - 31

# the mean of one set of random numbers is NOT the same as the mean of another
mean(runif(100))     mean(runif(100))

# cake is greater than biscuits
"cake"     "biscuits"

# c("A", "B", "Z") are found in the last 10 letters of the alphabet
c("A", "B", "Z")     LETTERS[16:26]

```
```{r ex254_4-solution}
1. TRUE, using ==
2. TRUE, using !=
3. FALSE, using >
This is another strange behaviour of R that I don't understand. I 
don't understand how or why one character object "cake" can be numerically greater than another
"biscuits", but R has some way of deciding. It works with any character object.
4. FALSE FALSE TRUE, using %in%
```
\  


$~$

### 2.5.5 `data.frame`
\

`data.frame`s are extremely important objects. This is the way most data is 
stored for data analysis. As we learned earlier, there's one column per variable
and one row per observation. `data.frame`s are simply collections of variables:
```{r}
factor2 <- rep(LETTERS[1:2], 5)
random <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)
toydata <- data.frame(numbers2, factor1, factor2, random)
toydata
```
\

To access variables in a data.frame, you simply use the `$` dollar sign.
```{r}
toydata$numbers2
```
\

Vectors are one-dimensional but data frames are two-dimensional: rows and columns. The function `dim()` shows you how many dimensions:

* First, rows 
* Second, columns

We know this to be 10 replicates (rows) and 4 variables (columns):
```{r}
dim(toydata)
```
\

To quickly select a few rows and/or columns, we can use the square brackets like for vectors, but we need to provide two numbers. 

* **First: the rows** we want to select
* **Second: the columns** we want to select. 
* Separated by a comma
* If you want to select all rows or columns, leave a blank space before or after the comma.

Like this: `dataframe[rows, columns]`.
```{r}
# If you want all columns then leave the second number blank.
# The first 5 rows of the data frame:
toydata[1:5, ]

# If you want all rows then leave the first number blank.
# The first and third columns of the data frame:
toydata[ , c(1, 3)]

# The first rows of columns 1 and 3:
toydata[1:5, c(1, 3)]
```
\

Having commas in the right places is important in `R`. If you don't have a 
comma to indicate both rows and columns, then you will encounter an error 
about "undefined rows" or "undefined columns". A missing or extra comma is a
really common mistake and easy to miss.  
\

Most of the time we will be using a different, more modern way of managing and 
selecting data from data frames (introduced in Chapter 4). 
It's a little more flexible and elegant. 
Using the square brackets `[ ]` is really great for doing very simple and 
quick data subsets, but they can get unwieldy when it comes to more complicated
data subsets involving logicals.  
\

You can read in `data.frame`s from your own data using the function 
`read.csv()`. Your data frame needs to be saved as a CSV file, in a data frame 
layout. You can do this easily in Excel using File -> Save As -> CSV (Comma delimited).  

Then you provide the path to the file. For example, on windows, if the 
file "data.csv" is stored in your "My Documents" folder, you use 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv("C:/Users/UserName/Documents/data.csv")
# (replace "UserName" with your user name)
```

On Mac, if the file was stored in your Documents folder then you may use 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
### *** CHECK
read.csv("~/Documents/data.csv")
```
\

There are a few requirements / good practices when preparing data in excel or other spreadsheet programs to save as a csv file.

1. One column per variable, one row per "replicate" (an individual piece of data
associated with that variable).
2. No empty columns or rows.
3. No empty cells. If there is a missing piece of data, put `NA` in the cell. `R`
understands this to be missing data.
4. Ideally, no spaces. Replace spaces in variable names and character or factor 
vectors with an underscore `_`.
5. Character variables should have quote marks `" "` or `' '` around each 
data point, otherwise `R` will interpret them as factors.

### **2.6 SIMPLE PLOTS**
\

`R` is an extremely powerful graphics generator. In recent years, this has 
extended to generation of things like interactive and multi-dimensional figures.
Check out for example this app that 
[catalogues all LEGO pieces in all sets of the LEGO world](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/lego-world.html), 
or this one that allows you to 
[explore recent crimes anywhere in the UK](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/crime-watch.html).
More apps, including many with biological data, are available in 
[this gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). All of these are powered 
by `R`.  

BUT, it all starts with a simple plot. It's _very_ easy to produce a plot
in `R`, and we'll run through some here. These are what we term simple 
**base `R`* graphics.  
\

**Histograms** can be produced using the `hist()` function.

```{r}
hist(toydata$random)
```
\

**Box plots** can be produced using the `boxplot()` function.

```{r}
boxplot(toydata$numbers2)
```
\

**Bar graphs** can be produced using the `barplot()` function.

```{r}
barplot(toydata$numbers2[1:5], names.arg = toydata$factor1[1:5], 
        ylab = "numbers2")
```

We introduced a couple of extre arguments here: `names.arg` labels the x axis
and `ylab` labels the y axis.  
\

**Scatter plots** can be produced using the `plot()` function, with both an 
x variable (first argument) and a y variable (second argument).

```{r}
plot(toydata$numbers2, toydata$random)
```
\

##### **< EXERCISE 5 >** Simple Plots
_Create a boxplot of `random` and a histogram of `numbers2`_.
```{r ex26_5, exercise = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

```
```{r ex26_5-hint, eval = FALSE}
Copy the code from the example boxplot and histogram, and replace the variable names.
```

### **2.7 CREATING AN R SCRIPT**
\ 

R code is saved in a file with the extension `.R`. In the same way as Micosoft 
Word knows to open files with `.docx` extensions and Adobe Reader knows to
open files with `.pdf` extensions, RStudio knows to open files with `.R` 
extensions, and to work with them in certain ways.  

When you open RStudio for the first time, there is an empty ("Untitled") `.R` file already there for you. Simply save this file wherever you like (and further `.R` files can be generated by using File --> New File --> R Script).  

_This is the file in which you're going to write code to fulfil the tasks in Section 2 of each Chapter._ In each Chapter you will cover one aspect of the analytical process.
You'll apply the knowledge and skills learned during the Chapter to a biological data set and 
add to this code file during each online workshop, so that by the end of the 
book, you'll have completed a full analysis including Tidying and Visualising 
your data, fitting a model and evaluating how well it fits the data, 
tweaking the data, visualisations and the model if necessary, until you have some 
reliable and reproducible results.  
\

If you wish, you can copy code from these worksheets into a second R file and practise coding in RStudio alongside completing these worksheets at home.

### **2.8 OTHER RESOURCES**
\

There's a huge amount of other resources out there in the web to help you 
learn basic `R` programming. For exmple, check out this tutorial from RStudio on 
[Programming Basics](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/04-Programming-Basics).


$~$

***
### **2.9 FINAL TIPS**
\

Use `?` to get help on a function. These help pages take a fair while to get used 
to, but they lay out what arguments a function takes, what those arguments 
are, what the output (value) of the function is, and some examples.  
\

We use the `#` (hash) symbol to create a comment: nothing after the `#` will be run
as code. It's good practise to comment your code as you go, so when you 
go back to it later, it makes sense to you. Trust me, you make life so much 
easier for your future self if you comment well!  
\

The internet is really useful. As you get used to R, you'll be able to find
blogs and articles and forums that give you answers. There are also R mailing
lists, but it's best not to email them until you're sure you've done everything
you can to solve your problem.  
\

If something goes wrong with your R coding (usually Errors), then 99.9% of the
time it's because you've made a mistake. R is very literal. Be careful!  
\

#### **< EXERCISE 6 >** Final Tips
_Correct the mistakes ('bugs') in the lines of code below, bearing in_
_mind the common, small mistakes mentioned in this Chapter. Keep going until you get the_
_right outputs!_
```{r ex29_6, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# a sequence from 4 to 40 in steps of 4
mynums <- seq(4, 40, 4,)
mynums

# the first 5 and last 5 letters of the alphabet
mychars <- LETTERS[c(1:5, 21:26)]
# length of mychars
length(Mychars)

# turn mychars into a factor
myfacs <- asfactor(mychars)

# create data frame
mydata <- data.frame(mynums, mychars, myfacs)
# see numbers
mydata$mynum
# first 5 rows of data frame
mydata[1:5]
# first 2 columns of data frame
mydata[1:2, ]

```

These are really common mistakes to make. Be aware!

### **< WORKSHOP >** R Basics
***
\

During this week's workshop, we're going to build a data frame of made-up data, similar to what was done in the first Chapter of the workbook. This will involve:

* creating random numeric vectors
* creating factor vectors
* creating character vectors
* building a data frame from existing vectors in R
* selecting parts of a data frame using `base R` methods

We will cover quick, basic plots in `base R`, including:

* histograms 
* boxplots
* barplots
* scatter plots

Finally, we will read in the data that we'll be using for the rest of these online sessions, which are saved as csv files. If you're not sure which one you're supposed to be using, check the DATA page of this workbook.  

You won't have encountered absolutely everything you need to do during the at-home study. To mention it again, a really important part of data skills and coding is being able to find answers to question and solutions to probelms yourselves, using whatever resources you have to hand, but especially the internet.  
\

##### **R BASICS: EXERCISES & QUESTIONS**
\

20-25 mins:  

1. First create a character object called `names` which is the first name of the people in your tutor group (including anyone who is missing). If there are two people in your group with the same name, then give each a number (i.e. `Jane1`, `Jane2`,... )
  * What is the length of this character vector?

2. Now create a numeric variable called `norm` which is a random normal distribution with the same length as the number of people in your tutor group. It should have a mean value of 7 and a variance of 1.
  * Can this normal distribution have values below zero?
  * Can the arguments of this vector be written in any order or does it have to be in the order you used?
  *The normal distribution is just one kind of distribution that you can draw random numbers from. Another distribution you are probably familiar with is the _uniform distribution_, where every number has an equal chance of being chosen. Search online to see whether you can find a function that will draw random numbers from a uniform distribution. 
  * What is the name of the function?
  * How would you create an object called `unif` which consists of 10 random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1?
  * If you had this object `unif` and you wanted to change those proportions to percentages, how would you do it?

3. Now create a factor vector called `sibs` which tells you whether each person in your tutor group has siblings. It should take the value `sis` if the person has sister(s), `bro` if the person has brother(s),`both` if they have both, and `neither` if they have neither. If the person is absent, use `NA`.
  + Hint: you may want to create a character vector first, and convert it into a factor.

4. Create a data frame for your tutor group of the 4 objects (`name`, `norm`, and `sibs`). Call it what you like :)
  * What is the name of this object?  
\


##### **BIOLOGICAL DATA**

20-25 mins:  

For the rest of the online workshops, we'll be using real biological data sets. These data sets are tailored slightly to your degree programs: check the DATA page for a summary of the data set and to find out which one you're using.

7. Read the CSV in to R. Save the object as:
  * `DNA_data` for the DNA and ageing data set from Huh _et al._ (2016) Maintenance of age in human neurons generated by microRNA-based neuronal conversion of fibroblasts. _eLife_, 5:e18648. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.18648.
  * `dogs_data` for the urban dogs data set from Majumder _et al._ (2016) Denning habits of free-ranging dogs reveal preference for human proximity. _Scientific Reports_, 6:32014. DOI: 10.1038/srep32014.
  * `pantheria_data` for the mammal life history data set from Jones _et al._ (2009) PanTHERIA: a species-level database of life history, ecology, and geography of extant and recently extinct mammals. _Ecology_, **90**, 2648. DOI: 10.1890/08-1494.1.

I want to encourage you to explore the data now. Usually these sections will be quite prescriptive, with specific tasks. Right now is just a good opportunity to get to know the data, which is _so_ important. You're free to explore as you wish, using the things you've learned in this Chapter, but here are some ideas of things you might want to do:

* How many variables, and how many replicates (i.e. the dimensions of the data frame)
* How many `numeric`, `character`, `factor`, `logical` or other different types of variable are there?
* Is there any missing data?
* What does a summary of the data frame tell you?
* Make a histogram of one of the numeric variables
* Make a boxplot of one of the factors (x axis) against one of the numeric variables (y axis)
* Make a scatterplot of two numeric variables against one another

##  2Â½ - Grammar of Graphics
\

Data visualisations are based on an inherent underlying **Grammar of Graphics**.
This framework was developed by 
[Leland Wilkinson](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447)
in the 1990's and then repurposed more recently by 
[Hadley Wickham](https://byrneslab.net/classes/biol607/readings/wickham_layered-grammar.pdf),
who is a chief scientist at RStudio.  

<div align="center">
   ![](www/ggplot2_logo.jpg){width="75px"}
</div>  

We will be using the `R` package `ggplot2` for our graphics. (`gg` stands for 
"grammar of graphics", and this is the second version of the package... hence 
the `2`).  
\

Click Continue for a quick overview of what the grammar of graphics means.

### GRAMMAR OF GRAPHICS 
\  

<div align="center">
   ![](www/GG.png){width="80%"}
</div>  
\

Any data visualisation is a set of different _layers_ of information, as illustrated
in the image above. We'll go through the most important ones from bottom to top.  

**Data** is the most fundamental base layer. All figures are plotted from data.  

**Aesthetics** describe the mapping of data onto the graph. Foremost, aesthetics are used 
to state what the x-variable and y-variable are, although they can extend to other 
variables for more complex graphs (e.g. a third variable to colour data points, 
or a third axis for a 3D graph).  

**Geometries** describe how aesthetics are represented. This principally includes
the graph "type" (e.g. histogram, boxplot, barplot, scatter plot etc.).

**Facets** can be used to split a figure into sub-plots. Sometimes putting all 
data in one space is difficult to read, so a plot can be split out into different
facets according to chosen aesthetics.  

**Statistics** describe any models used to describe or predict the data. This 
may commonly include means and standard deviations, linear models or loess 
curves.  

**Coordinates** are not commonly used for simple graphs, but are useful when 
projecting the data into a different coordinate space. Mapping is the 
most obvious example: the same data can be plotted using many different 
geographic coordinate systems.



### `ggplot`
\

Functions and arguments in `ggplot2` mirror these layers. You'll encounter 
these methods in the next several chapters. The reason we're using `ggplot`
is because the graphics is produces are generally far better quality than 
the `base` `R` graphics. 

* `base R` graphics **GOOD** for: 
  + Quick, simple plots
  + Fast viewing of your data
  + Extremely flexible customisation _if you take considerable time to learn methods and code._
* `base R` graphics are **NOT good** for:
  + Not good for using for publications if you rely on default options, which are ugly.
  + Not good for customising plots _unless time is taken to learn how_
  + Not good for coherent coding (no underlying framework, order of functions very important)
  + Not good for tutorials available

* `ggplot` graphics are **GOOD** for:
  + Quickly producing and customising aesthetically pleasing plots 
  + Publication-quality figures out the box
  + Coherent code (clear underlying framework, order of functions flexible)
  + Easy access tutorials
* `ggplot` graphics are **NOT good** for:
  + Not good given lack of flexibility outside available options 
  + Not good for quick plots as more code is needed
  + Not good for viewing data fast
\

Here's an example of a scatter plot made using `ggplot` with the  with the toy 
data. 
\

```{r}
ggplot(toydata, aes(x = numbers2, y = random)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue4") +
  xlim(0, 20) + ylim(-2, 2) +
  xlab("Even numbers") + ylab("Random normal") +
  theme_minimal()
```
\

Take a look at the graph and the code, and it's possible to match up the different layers:

* The **DATA** is `toydata`.
* The **AESTHETICS** (in this case just x and y variables) are defined using `aes()`
* The **COORDINATES** are altered in a very simple way by changing the x and y 
axis limits using `xlim()` and `ylim()`
* The **THEME** is changed by applying the minimal theme using `theme_minimal()`.
